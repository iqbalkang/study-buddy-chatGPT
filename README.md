# testing-parsing-postgresql

Create a .env file that has:
1. DB_HOST = localhost
2. DB_USER = user/owner of database (I used postgres as the owner)
3. DB_PASSWORD = database password
4. DB_NAME = name of database not schema
5. DB_PORT = port that database is on (postgres was on 5433 for me)
6. PORT = port the express server is on
7. API_KEY = api key for openAI
